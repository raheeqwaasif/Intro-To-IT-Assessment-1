        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%"></p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size:300%"> Overview</h2>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">MyMangaTracker is a personal database website which centralizes one’s manga reading and collecting journey. This website is designed for collectors and casual readers alike. For the regular readers, it would allow them to track which manga they have read, and when they read it. They can also make a read list to keep track of titles that they want to read. Also, a suggestions tab would introduce the reader to other manga similar to their taste. For those interested in buying the physical copies, MyMangaTracker would show the user where to buy it and allow them to track what volumes they have bought, and what volumes they are missing. One major obstacle with collecting physical manga is that the series may go out of print. So MyMangaTracker would make it easy to see if the series you are looking to buy is still in print or not. Also, it can give the user options for where they can buy it from, from physical stores to online stores.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size:300%"> Motivation</h2>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">As stated in my personal information, one of my greatest passions is reading manga, and collecting the physical copies to expand my collection. Through this passion I have come to realise the lack of a centralized, easy to use website or app that allows me to catalogue what volumes I have bought, what I wish to buy, other titles I might be interested in. So far, I have been using the notes app on my phones, which is passable but does not offer a manga related user experience. Through MyMangaTracker, I wish to create something that makes keeping track of your collection easy and accessible. There is a website called MyAnimeList from which I am drawing inspiration, as a website for creating a watchlist already exists for anime, but no such thing exists for manga to my knowledge. Thought my anime list does have a manga section, it is rather similar to the anime section and does not focus on the tracking aspect that I am trying to achieve with MyMagnaTracker.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size:300%"> Description</h2>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">When the user first opens the website, they will be greeted by a home page. On this home page there will be:</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">-	Large banner in the top-middle of the page, showing new releases, what online stores have sales going on, and other relevant news.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">-	Current serialising manga (smaller list menu on the right side of the website, and also if the latest volume is out in English)</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">-	“Manga you might like” recommended list on a side scrolling menus, like those seen on streaming services like Netflix or Disney+</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">-	Above the news banner will be a prominent search bar, which allows the user to immediately jump into they search.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%" >-	Near the bottom of the page will be an A-Z catalogue of every manga that is on the website.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">The user will have the option to create an account, which is highly recommended as it saves the users read list, collection, reading status and history. </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">When clicking on a particular title, it will take to user to a dedicated page for that manga. On each manga’s page it will show information about that certain manga like the title, name of author, release date of first chapter. There will be a prominent picture of the manga’s first volume, next to which will be prominent “Add to read list” button. A “Collection status” dropdown menu will be under the thumbnail visual, which will list out in aesthetic squares. The user can click on each volumes square to open a smaller drop down to tick off if they have collected it or not, and see whether or not they are still in print, and the stores where they can buy it from. Near the bottom of the small dropdown menu would be user reviews, in which any user can write a review for that volume and give it a rating out of 5.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">The “My Collection” section of the website is an integral component. Here it will list out every manga that a user has added to their MyMangaTracker personal database. It would show what volumes they have collected for which series. They can also note down when they read it, and acquisition dates for each individual volume. </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">The most similar website that exists is AniList. to differentiate, I will implement components for physical collection, like volume release date and availability, which is an aspect that AniList does not have.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size:300%"> Tools & Technologies</h2>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">For software, HTML & CSS could be used to design and layout the website. For the database of all the manga in the world, it would be rather difficult to input them all individually. AniList has an available API that has over 500,000 anime and manga titles to be used as a database. However, there are some limitations to this API as it is not available for commercial use, which MyMangaTracker could become. </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">Another API that is available is the Kitsu API. This allows for Trending Manga to also be implemented, but again this may have legal issues. </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">Hardware wise, a server-side database could be used to store the information of every user, for which large physical server modules need to be used.</p>
        <br>

        <h2 style="font-size:300%"> Skills Required</h2>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">For the actual creation of the website, I need to be proficient at HTML and CSS. UX must be kept in mind. Things like Usability principles. Also, the overall aesthetic of the website must be nice to look at, but not too much that its overwhelming to the user. </p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size:300%" style > Outcome</h2>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">If MyMangaTracker were to become a fully fledged website, it has the potential to become a major competitor for websites like MyAnimeList and AniList. This is because its more niche that the others and is geared towards a slightly different target audience. The original problem of there not being a dedicated website for collecting physical will be solved entirely, as easy access to information about thousands of titles and where to buy will greatly supplement the manga collecting community. Moreover, it would increase interest in collecting manga around the world, as more people are exposed to information like printing, translation, and serialisation details. For existing manga collectors, it would make the process of cataloguing their collection much more convenient. Also, by being able to track when they read and acquired something, they can see how long they have been collecting for.</p>
