        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">Each of these tests represents a particular part of an individual. For me, I was assigned the Campaigner personality type through the Myers-Briggs test, my learning style test showed that I am a Visual learner, and in my deductive reasoning test I got a 90%. First, the Personality test. To me the Campaigner personality type means that I work well with people and genuinely care about their feelings. However another part of this personality assignment is that I feel that I am very open minded. I am always willing to debate with people on their points of views and always want to learn about how or why people would think in a certain way. The creativity aspect also resonates with me deeply, as I am always trying to think of new thing that I could create, or different ways in which I could approach a problem that I am facing. Though these personality assignment test are not 100% fact, some links between ones personality can be made. </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">The Learning styles test assigned me as a visual learner. However, I do not really agree as I feel that I like to learn things in any manner, if it is something that I am personally interested in. Finally, the deductive reasoning test. I feel like this test is an important one to take as it shows if I am capable of solving tricky situations which instead of qualifications require critical thinking. Moreover, this is a test that many employer could implement as critical thinking and deductive reasoning is often one of the main criteria when looking to hire new employees.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">When working in a team, thanks to my Campaigner personality type, I get along well with everyone in the team. Especially during the first semester of university, where people in the class donâ€™t really know each other, I am often the one to start the conversation and start to get to know the people Ill be working with. Moreover, this personality type allows me to be able to quickly avert or solve conflict that may arise within the group with minimal confrontation. My diverse learning styles would allow me to keep up with the rest of the group, no matter how they might prefer to learn. The campaigner personality typed paired with my good deductive reasoning allows me to solve almost any problem that may arise in a group scenario, as I believe that working together is he quickest, most efficient and most fun way to solve problems. </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">When forming a team, it is important to have people with diverse personalities, strengths and weaknesses. For example, if a group is filled with campaigners, they would spend all their time talking to each other and little time getting any work done. Therefore, I could be the social-support-beam of the group, ensuring that everyone gets along. This means that to counterbalance, someone with a more focused and driven personality type might be need to in-turn ground me and make me do my work. Moreover, deductive reasoning is not the only type of reasoning that is required in a group. Numerical and verbal reasoning is also important. Simple things like dividing workload can become difficult if not everyone is proficient at these things. Moreover, good deductive reasoning skills can allow me to discern if everyone is pulling their own weight. This paired with the Campaigner personality type I can ensure that everyone does their work in a non-hostile and non-confrontational way. I would rather lift other people up than put hem down. So instead of getting angry at them for not doing their work, I would jokingly push them into keeping pace with the rest of the team.</p>
