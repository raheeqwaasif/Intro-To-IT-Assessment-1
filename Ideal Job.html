        <p style="font-size:200%">My dream is to become a game developer and designer. I want to be a master at both as it allows for more flexibility within the gaming industry, to be able to come up with the ideas and make them, though I am more passionate about the design aspect. More specifically narrative design, though it is hard to find job for such a position. </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">This specific job is the Manager of Content Efficiency. I chose this job because it is not only a senior position which allows for me to leverage the years of experience I seek to create, but also that it covers numerous areas of the game development process. It will allow me to work people from the Client development team and the art team for example. Currently, I do not have any of the qualifications that are require</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">On the website, it says that the required qualification for this specific job is experience in C/C++. Through the Bachelor of IT I wish to gain proficiency in this language. Furthermore, it asked for experience in game development, which I hope to gain once I transfer into software engineering and specialize in Game Development in my Second and Third Years. Moreover, 6+ years working as a software engineer and 3+ working in a software engineering leadership position. Though I do not meet any of these qualifications now, I want to develop my portfolio as a game Developer.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">To obtain these qualifications, I would preferably start an internship at a game development company so that I can gain software engineering and game development experience simultaneously. There are many indie companies in Australia that might offer such positions. Also, to gain more design experience, I will learn how to use software like Game Maker, Unity etc to broaden my knowledge and possibilities. </p>
