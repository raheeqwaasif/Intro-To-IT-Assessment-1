        <h1 style="font-size:400%">Introduction</h1>
        <p style="font-size:200%">My name is Raheeq Bhatti, and I am 18 years old. Iâ€™ve been living in Australia for almost 10 years now, as I came here from my home country of Pakistan in 2012. I was 9 years old when I immigrated here, so I have been raised in a mixture of both cultures. This has also allowed me to be proficient in two different languages, Urdu and English, though my Urdu could use some work. I studied my first 2 years in Pakistan, but then Grade 3 onwards I studied in Australia. I graduated VCE last year and I immediately enrolled into university. Though I was just short of the requirements of my desired course, I chose IT with the hopes to transfer later. My dream is to become a game developer and designer. I want to be a master at both as it allows for more flexibility within the gaming industry, to be able to come up with the ideas and make them, though I am more passionate about the design aspect. More specifically, narrative design is my favourite component.</p>
