        <h1 style="font-size:400%">Interest in IT</h1>
        <p style="font-size:200%">I have always had an interest in IT since I was a child. My father works in IT, so I have been exposed to it for a very long time. My interest in IT stems from my passion for video games. I want to know not only how they are made, but all the other aspects that go into it. IT comes into play when looking at online games, and how they connect millions of people around the world. Big multiplayer games in my childhood were League of Legends, which I have been playing since October 2013, Minecraft, and Team Fortress 2, among others.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">Apart from game development, another interest in IT of mine is how communities can form online and how they share and distribute information among each other. Things like Discord and forums like Reddit have always been greatly interesting to me. Especially during the last 2 years during the Covid-19 pandemic, a large chunk of my VCE classes and work was done online. To make this easier, me and friends made a discord server that we use to this day to ask questions about schoolwork, hang out and play games.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">My father is a Cyber Security consultant, so over the years he has probed me to learn how to code and learn about networking and similar things. Though I did not delve too deep into it and rather focused on my passion for video games, it gave me much needed exposure which let me not be completely blind while going into the IT world.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">I chose to come to RMIT because it seemed very casual compared to other universities, which is something that I really like about it. Also, I investigated the teachers and professors at RMIT, and I thought there would be no one better to teach me the skills I need to become a game developer that the exceptional teaching staff at RMIT. Not only that, but I also love the extra-curricular activities that are available at RMIT. Though I am yet to join one, I really like the wide selection of clubs that I can join. The way the programs are structed appealed to me a lot.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:200%">While studying the Bachelor of IT, I hope to learn a wide spread of topics related to the field. However, I want to learn a variety of coding languages like Python, Java, HTML & CSS, and SQL. These will build a solid foundation which will allow me to later learn C and C++, which from what I have researched is the most common languages used for video game development. Moreover, I wish to learn Game Design by perhaps doing a Bachelor of Game Design after I graduate from the Bachelor of IT or optimally, the Bachelor of Software Engineering.</p>
